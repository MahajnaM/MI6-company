# MI6-company
The project built on MultiThreading, OOP and OOD concepts.
I use singleton concept and a lot of different design patterns.
The project simulates james bond movies, there is "M" , she is the boss, she is responsible for everything, and everything pass throw her .
There is "Q" who is responsible for the arsenal.
There are a lot of agents that take guns and cars...
its just like the movies...
